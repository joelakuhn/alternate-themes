# Alternate Themes

Alternate Themes is a wordpress plugin that allows you to specify an alternative theme for a page. Once installed, a meta box will allow super users to select an installed theme from the dropdown. After updating the page, all theme customizations will be available on both the page editor and the rendered page including page templates.

You can also preview themes by selecting from a dropdown in the admin bar. Previewing a theme applies to all pages on a site, making it easy to test a new theme without disturbing users.
